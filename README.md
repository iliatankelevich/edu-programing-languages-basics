## tasks:
1. write three methods that calculates sum of 3 numbers from a list
  a. using for loop
  b. using while loop
  c. using recursion 
2. write a mothod that combines two lists to one list by taking elements alternately
  for example, given two lists [1,2,3] and [a,b,c,d] the result will be [1,a,2,b,3,c,d]
3. given a list of numbers, create the largest posible number by joining them as string, for example given the list [2,1,9,50] the result will be 95021
4. write a method that calculates the n number in Fibonacci series
5. write a program that finds all the ways to put '+', '-' or nothing between the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in aim to get sum of 100. for example 1+2+34-5+67-8+9=100
